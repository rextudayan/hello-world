# hello-world
Learning the world of coding.
I'm a fitness entrepreneur who is looking to expand his reach and help others with their fitness goals by creating a training app.
I have been working as a Personal Trainer, and recently expanded to helping out more people by providing online coach. I want to take this to another level, and start my own mobile app! I have little to no experience with coding, and I am willing to learn as much as I can to turn these dreams into a reality!
